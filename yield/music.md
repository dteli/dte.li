I am an amateur musician. For the most part I use [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason) to create mostly electronic-influenced music, although I don't aim at any genre in particular.

Music is released under my own label, [Prion Noise Ghost](http://png.st), although I use [DistroKid](https://distrokid.com/) to get it onto streaming platforms.


Some of my music is available on my [Soundcloud]().


All of it is currently available on [Bandcamp](https://etdr.bandcamp.com/).
