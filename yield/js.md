## [eksward](https://eksward.herokuapp.com/) {#blue-badge}

<p>![eksward](/img/yield/staticsjs/eksward.png)</p>

Here's an app I created with React and Redux to solve crossword puzzles.
(In order to use it you'll have to upload an Across Lite puzzle file;
for examples I suggest [Brendan Emmett Quigley's](https://www.brendanemmettquigley.com/) site,
he publishes in this format.)

I styled this app after the NYT crossword puzzle solver, which also uses React,
but trust me, I had to figure out a lot myself. The Across Lite parser itself I'm particularly proud of.

## [vloeistof](https://vloeistof.co/) {#red-badge}

<p>![the drinks app in action](/img/yield/staticsjs/vloeistof.png)</p>

As a team of three (myself, Lindsey, and Reese; Team 3D for life), we taught ourselves Angular and created this app in four weeks.

"Vloeistof" means "liquid" or, colloquially, alcohol in Dutch/Flemish (shoutout to Ing, our Belgian instructor). This is a mixed drinks app, for mixing your own drinks or pulling them from the API at [TheCocktailDB.com](https://thecocktaildb.com/). You can add drinks to your profile, curate your favorites,
post on your and other people's drinks, and more.
