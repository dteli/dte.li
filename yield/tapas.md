I still have zips of the tracks from some of our shows, but alas it isn't 2011 anymore so I can't just throw up a link to a Mediafire folder.<!-- ^[It's a great thankfulness exercise when I remember that I guess I was lucky to live through a (probably *the*) half-decade of easy, free music sharing across genres and popularities. Turns out that isn't the norm. Wish I would have been a little bit older with lots more disk space but I'm grateful to have benefitted at all.] --> Let me know if you'd like some tracklists, though.

<!-- I will probably pick this up again in the future when I have a modern-enough video card. -->
