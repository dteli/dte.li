## Bounce Haus!

This was I and my friend Josh's radio show from 2009-2011 on WIUX, the student-run radio station for IU Bloomington.

* [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bouncehaus)
* [bounce.haus](http://bounce.haus/) (currently defunct)
<!-- * [Soundcloud](soundcloud.com/bounce_haus) -->

I still have zips of the tracks from some of our shows, but alas it isn't 2011 anymore so I can't just throw up a link to a Mediafire folder.<!-- ^[It's a great thankfulness exercise when I remember that I guess I was lucky to live through a (probably *the*) half-decade of easy, free music sharing across genres and popularities. Turns out that isn't the norm. Wish I would have been a little bit older with lots more disk space but I'm grateful to have benefitted at all.] --> Let me know if you'd like some tracklists, though.

## PrimeGrid

At one point I had made my way onto the list at [the list of largest known primes](https://primes.utm.edu/primes/) because I was finding primes with my computer in ~~my~~ its spare time using [PrimeGrid](http://www.primegrid.com/). Turns out three of my primes are still on the top-5000 list, [here's my profile](https://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=3247).

The largest prime I have found is $12851074^{131072} + 1$.

I have a better graphics card now but just haven't been mining for 'em recently, my experience was that it became harder to find new ones on the list after awhile, or maybe I just wasn't subscribing to the right projects.
