In the first months of 2020, I was a student at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/), a data science bootcamp, in Chicago. Here are some of the projects I worked on. (in progress)

* [Morphology prediction of galaxies](./morphology.html)

* [Linear regression of record prices](./discogs.html)

* [Analysis of MTA turnstile data](./mta.html)
