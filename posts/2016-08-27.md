My cat, Atsuo Toggle, is named after the drummer from [Boris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_(band)).
Since his name is half Japanese, I thought it would be nice to have it written in its original form.
After figuring out the kanji and katakana, I contracted some calligraphy. I'm very pleased with the
result, much more so than Atsuo.

This is the fine work of [Leopon](https://www.fiverr.com/s2/4f6ae72607) on fiverr.
I paid an additional $10 to ship the original hard copy, definitely a great investment, highly recommended.
