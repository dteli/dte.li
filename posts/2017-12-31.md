Since August, I've been at work at my new job a lot of the time (should write about that sometime for sure) but still have had some success in making more music. I've moved on from just making sketches to compiling generally longer tracks that fit into an EP or (not yet but eventually) a full album-type release. 

Simply as a hobby (as opposed to a monetizable venture), I've decided to put some of my music up on streaming services (Spotify, Google, Apple, etc.). I'm using [DistroKid](https://distrokid.com/) to distribute my music to stores, I was using a different site but you can't beat DistroKid's pricing, \$20/year for unlimited albums/EPs/singles. They even got me to pony up an additional \$15 for a customizable label name and some other features I probably didn't need. 

Anyway, If you're looking for something to listen to, it's all under my real name (Eli T. Drumm). I've also just finished uploading the last of the tracks of my first EP to SoundCloud (been doing one of these a week), I'll try to embed it below.

Hope everyone's 2017 went all right.
