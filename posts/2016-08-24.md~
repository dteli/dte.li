OK, so,

I've started posting on here before once or twice already, but have only managed to throw up scraps before slatecleaning.
I haven't ever really had a good idea of what I want to do or a plan for keeping up with whatever,
<!-- not that I haven't given it way too much thought anyway. -->
Now that I'm out of my master's program, I'm thinking long re: my site and this "posts" portion in particular.

dte.li is already four years and several incarnations old and I keep thinking about what to do with it.
What I'm going to say is that for the next decade at least, I will be considering this site active;
when I have something to throw up I'll throw it up, and if a year goes by without adding content
the site is still just as active (not in practice, of course, but I know I can't commit to results yet,
potentially that'll be 2026--2036).


I am going to make peace with intermittency and allow myself a decade or so to find a workable rhythm.
If nothing happens, that's OK too, mostly.
The idea is to make it so I'm not overwhelmed and choice-paralyzed with regards to<!-- [^*w.r.t.* or *wrt*] -->
where and how to apply what limited energy and focus I can scrape together here and there.


    
  
<!-- With regularity and coherence, this would actually be a  -->



Anyway, without consideration of relative frequencies, I'm envisioning
* updates
    * me
    * this site
* catchall writing
    * stories
    * ideas
* lists[^I have a direction I've been wanting to move with this]
* art, experiments
    * music
    * photos
    * stream-of-subconsciousness sequences
* projects
    * [who knows]
    * recent tech nanoadventures (accomplishments, fun finds and facts)
* serial/regular-feature content[^*spaaaaaringly!* .. I have one or two ideas here]

Breakdown subject to change.
I don't really want to develop a tag system, it feels too fine-grained and I know I'd end up with loads of singleton tags.
What I think I'll likely end up doing is developing a coarser category system along the lines of the above list
with the option to subclass when it makes sense.

<!-- <\!--It also feels like I'd be presuming anyone wants to hear more of me typing.-\-> -->



I don't know how much of my train of thought and current approach as I've described it will resonate or seem reasonable to anyone, maybe I can flesh it out better at some point.

Aaaand that's about it I guess.
