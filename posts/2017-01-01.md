## A

Well, that's over.


## B

I made a mix the other week, it's chiefly a reflection of some recent event(s) in my life (it's "based on a true playlist")
This evening I uploaded it as a New Years'
let's-be-done-with-this ritual, I *should* rework the mixing both volumewise and track-transition-wise,
but 2016 is over so this is as well.
Feel free to down and listen.

Not sure how best to reliably stream in 2017 without running into
problems with content flaggers (or paying for the bandwidth myself). 
For now, <!--or at least until Dropbox axes the public folder later this year, -->here's a plain ogg-in-a-box.
