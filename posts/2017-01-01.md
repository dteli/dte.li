I made a mix the other week, it's chiefly a reflection of some recent event(s) in my life (it's "based on a true playlist")
This evening I uploaded it as a New Years'
let's-be-done-with-this ritual, I *should* rework the mixing both volumewise and track-transition-wise,
but 2016 is over so this is as well.
