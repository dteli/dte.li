I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana.
From age 10 on up until grad school I lived in Indiana.

I studied cognitive science and philosophy (of logic, science) at Indiana University
from '07 through '011.
From mid-2013 to early '016 I lived in the Netherlands
pursuing a [MSc in Logic][] at the University of Amsterdam,
which I recently completed ([relevant reading for all your free time](aanvullend/rmtc.pdf "RMTC")).


After returning to the US I lived in the Ithaca, NY area for awhile; currently I'm back around Indianapolis until I embark on Whatever Comes Next.



I have a cat named Atsuo Toggle.
