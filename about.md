I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana.
From age 10 on up until grad school I lived in Indiana.

I studied cognitive science and philosophy (of logic, science) at Indiana University
from '07 through '011.
From mid-2013 to early '016 I lived in the Netherlands
pursuing a [MSc in Logic][] at the University of Amsterdam,
which I recently completed ([relevant reading for all your free time](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2280103/dteli/rmtc.pdf "RMTC"))


I'm now living in the Ithaca, NY area.



I have a cat named Atsuo Toggle.
