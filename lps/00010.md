D/P/I is DJ Purple Image.



There are what sound like rhythms, sometimes laid atop each other,
sometimes committed to for longer segments of the track,
sometimes followed by a few voices and sometimes by more.
The voices themselves sound pretty coherent, like they came from the same sound bank,
which isn't a good or bad thing necessarily.

Looking at a bug outside makes me think of this music as kind of insectoid.
Like you could imagine a colony of termites rocking out to this.
It's not alien music, it's definitely from earth.

"Ecstatics" is probably the most danceable track, if that's interesting for you.

Sound art can get boring pretty fast (I'm a plebian, what of it) but this doesn't fall into that,
at least it didn't for me, even on the nine-and-a-half-minute "Semantics".

As always, I would love to know how this was made.
