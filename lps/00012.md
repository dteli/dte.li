It starts out with outer-space sounds and then goes dark.
Actually this whole album is pretty dark. One might even say... atavistic, ehem.

Really that's a good name for this music.
I feel like I'm in prehistoric times when listening to it.
Like, some music sounds like dinosaur times, and this sounds like humans
slowly hunter-gatherering their way across the earth out from Africa.
It sounds like a soundtrack to *something*, anyway.

This probably would sound better louder than I'm currently playing it, but I'm trying to work
at the same time.

Maybe some of it could be in space still. Cavemen in space, we'll call it.
