Now here's an album I've loved for years and finally own on vinyl.
Probably the best White Rainbow album, and yet also the most accessible, especially next to a lot of his self-released content.

The first track in particular is really great, has a nice build that takes a long time to get where it's going but isn't boring at any point, and a nice cooldown about which I would say the same.

The vocals are really nice and sound at home on each track, as are the percussion and guitars.
Also the synths.
Actually, it all sounds well *together*, that's the important bit.
