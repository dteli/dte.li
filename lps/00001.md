I'm going to start off with one of the LPs I received from [Shelter Press](http://shelter-press.org/).

Starts off slowly, but by the second track I'm on drugs, or wishing I was. Some of the tracks are more blippy or fuzzy, some are more ambient.

One thing I've been thinking about recently, getting back into making music myself a little, is that making music like this is a certain kind of difficult.
There's a lot of negative space in these tracks, which you might think would make it easier to create, because there's fewer notes that need to be created,
but I don't think that's the case. I wonder how much boils down to having interesting sounds.

A neat thing, aside from the detailed liner notes, is that the album comes with a very landscape poster showing the dot's travels. The notes say:
"Upon completion of a particularly ambitious 90-meter panoramic wall drawing, experimental composers Christina Vantzou and John Also Bennett were invited to interpret the work as a musical graphic score."
I guess this is that. .. ah, yes, "Comes with a 180cm leporello reproducing the original 9000cm wall drawing."
Hey, I learned a [new word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leporello) today.
