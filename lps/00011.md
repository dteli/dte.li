I don't know if "zu" should be capitalized or not. I'm applying English caps rules to German as a default.





Most of these tracks are just a little too subtle to be psychedelic trip playlist material,
although that's what came to mind at a few points for me.
We have soundscapes and we have more compositiony tracks.

I don't know, I didn't get a lot out of this but I'll try again at some point.
