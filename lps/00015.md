Thinking on it, I'd probably have to say Space Dimension Controller is in my top five favorite artists.


So here we have another great track, or two plus two remixes of "Exostack".
The vinyl only has one of the remixes but I'm including the other one (although it's not as good anyway).

"Exostack" itself is pretty good, sounds like classic SDC.

The Kornél Kovács remix is the better of the two.

"Biopan" sounds kind of similar, honestly, like it was made with the exact same presets and sounds
put together in a different way, but mellower.
