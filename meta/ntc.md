# metaabout


This blog is generated with [Hakyll][], a (the?) static site generator written in Haskell.

Over time my Hakyll config has become more personalized, but
I still owe a good deal to several of the folks who've contributed to the [examples][Hakyll examples]
gallery.


I ♥ [Pandoc][].
<!-- &#9829; -->


I wrote the [HTML][HTML5] and [CSS][] (by way of [Sass][]) myself.

I usually apply a coat of [normalize.css][] and/or [Autoprefixer][]
but it's not like I really know what the relevant current best practices
are.



Fonts are served by [Google's Fonts][Google Fonts].
The typeface used for almost all text is [Merriweather][];
`code` and other `monospaced text` is rendered in [Inconsolata][Inconsolata site].


dte.li is hosted with [NearlyFreeSpeech.net][].
I've been with NFS for years now and can't recommend them highly enough.
Since the entire site is static I don't need no server-side devilry
and they don't make me pay for it
(2012--present, $6 total (± some cents)).


Some resources (images, pretty much) are pulled in from my [Dropbox][].


The <dte.li> domain is registrar'd with [switchplus][].


I want to go into more detail with several of these items later
but yeah, this is my general tool-platform-technology suite.

------------

*This is version **3.8** of dte.li (qua website).*

Might you be looking for [this other five-letter-Liechtenstein-domain Eli-run website?][eli.li]
(I explicitly recommend checking [Alter-]Eli's site out if that somehow didn't pique your
attention. If you're an Eli with a ***.li please get in touch with us, we're looking to expand!)
